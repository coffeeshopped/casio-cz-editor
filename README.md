# casio-cz-editor

A patch editor for some of the Casio CZ family of synthesizers, written in Max.

## Usage

To use this software, you'll need a copy of Max from Cycling '74, which can be downloaded from their website: <a href="https://cycling74.com/downloads/">https://cycling74.com/downloads/</a>.

Once you have Max installed, open the file cz-101.maxpat to run the editor. Further instructions are shown within the editor.

## Background

I first wrote this editor for myself to use with my Casio CZ-101. It works pretty well, but has some small bugs still. If you have an iPhone or iPad, I've created an app called CZ Touch which is a lot more polished and full-featured, available here: <a href="https://coffeeshopped.com/cz-touch">https://coffeeshopped.com/cz-touch</a>
